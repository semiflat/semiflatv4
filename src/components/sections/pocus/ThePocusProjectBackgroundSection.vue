                            use
                            the full potential of their product and customer data to identify the highest-value
                            opportunities. It helps salespeople by identifying product champions, setting custom alerts to
                            capture opportunities as they happen, and even lets them create custom, conditional groups of
                            users without writing any code. </p>

                            The Co-founder of Pocus contacted Semiflat in the early stages of developing their product. They
                            had already created the back-end of the application but needed help coming up with the look and
                            feel as well as the conceptual design of certain features. What followed was a many-month-long
                            and-counting iterative collaboration as the product continued to grow.

                            with closely in order to produce multiple variations of one feature in a short period of time.
