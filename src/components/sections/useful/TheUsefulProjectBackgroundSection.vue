            <p class="text-[#545959] mb-8">The founders of Useful are product managers who previously worked at a big
              tech company. Their idea for an app was born from a shared struggle to stay on top of the customer
              discovery process. They realized organizing their work manually with spreadsheets provides little
              visibility and isnâ€™t scalable. There had to be a better way! After discovering that there was no solution
              on the market, they took matters into their own hands. They embarked on a mission to help companies build
              closer relationships with their customers and extract insights from their conversations.</p>
